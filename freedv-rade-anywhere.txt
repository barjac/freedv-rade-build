### How to use a different 'base' directory for your instalation of freedv-rade-build ###

##########################################################################################

 The installed rade system creates around ~1.9GB of files in your user's home folder and 
 double this if you make a backup, this is not a problem if you have plenty of space, but
 if you are short on disk space then you can arrange for the main FreeDV installed system
 to be anywhere you like.

 This does involve some knowledge of Linux permissions, disk partitions and the directory
 structure though and unless you have a pressing reason to do this it is highly recommended
 to use the default settings which place everything under your home folder.

##########################################################################################


 1. Create a new folder called e.g. 'rade' on a partition that has plenty of space available
    OR create a new partition of around 5GB and create a mount point for this partition.
    
 2. Make sure that the new folder is read/write enabled for your regular user.
    The freedv-rade-build script will halt with a warning if it cannot write to the base folder.

 3. As your user run the following command in a terminal using your own
  'full/path/to/your/base/folder' :

    'echo "basedir=full/path/to/your/base/folder" > /home/$USER/.freedv-rade-build.cfg'
    
    NOTE copy/paste everything between the '' into your terminal and then edit the folder
    path and name in the command, before hitting ENTER. You should see no response unless
    an error occured.

 4. Now follow the normal instructions for using freedv-rade-build (freedv-rade-build.md)
    and the space used in your home folder will be minimal.
    
    Enjoy FreeDV!
